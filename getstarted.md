This page has information on getting started with CloudCoder.

**Note**: the documentation is a work in progress.

If you are considering adopting CloudCoder for your course and
would like to try it out, you can request an account on
our [demo server](demo.html).

Here is the process for setting up your own CloudCoder installation:

1. [Provision the servers](install/servers.html)
2. [Build the CloudCoder software](install/build.html)
3. [Deploy the CloudCoder software](install/deploy.html)
4. [Create a course and add student accounts](install/course.html)
5. [Add problems](install/problems.html)
