			<p>Welcome to CloudCoder!</p>

<p>CloudCoder is an open source web-based programming exercise system.
It is designed to make it easy for instructors in introductory
programming courses to assign short exercises to students for
skills development and assessment.  Currently, exercises in
Java, Python, and C/C++ are supported.</p>

<p>Because CloudCoder is web-based, it is easy for students to
use.  The only software needed for students to work on exercises
is a web browser.  The <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a> page
shows CloudCoder in action.</p>

<p>To run CloudCoder, you need two Linux servers: one to host the
web application and database, and one to compile and test student
submissions.  Only the web/database server needs to be
network-facing.  See the <a href="getstarted.html">Getting Started</a>
page for details on how to install CloudCoder.</p>

<p>The <a href="repository.html">CloudCoder execise repository</a>
is a database of freely-redistributable exercises written by
CloudCoder users.  You can easily import problems from the repository
into your own CloudCoder installation for your students to
use.  You can also publish the exercises you write to the repository.</p>

<p>If you are an instructor interested in adopting CloudCoder,
you can request an account on our <a href="demo.html">demo server</a>.</p>
