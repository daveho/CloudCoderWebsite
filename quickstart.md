**Note**: the documentation is a work in progress.

This Quickstart guide helps you configure CloudCoder as quickly as possible, though in a manner that is less secure and less scalable than a complete installation.  Specifically:

* Running CloudCoder directly (i.e. without configuring an apache reverse-proxy as detailed in the full [Getting Started](getstarted.html)) will not use SSL to connect to he server.
* Running the webapp and builder on the same machine may not scale up.
